       <p class="content2"> Businesses rely on software to perform work. Some applications are procured and deployed from third parties, such as email 
           server applications. But many organizations retain a staff of skilled developers that create the applications and interfaces
            -- such as APIs -- needed to deliver critical business capabilities and services. Applications might be coded in a wide
             array of popular languages and integrated with other applications to create smooth and seamless interactions between
              different applications. Developers might also be tasked with creating interactive business websites and building mobile 
              applications. The trend toward agile or continuous development paradigms require developers to be 
           increasingly involved with IT operations, such as deploying and monitoring applications.</p>

    <p class="content2"> Computing has penetrated practically every part of business and much of our personal lives. The ubiquity of computing -- also referred to as pervasive computing -- is another reason why IT is critical. Computing devices have evolved well beyond personal computers and servers. Today, all businesses and most individuals have and use multiple computing devices, including phones, tablets, laptops, game consoles and even doorbells, thermostats, vacuums and many kitchen appliances.

        Virtually all these devices, many of which are part of the IoT, tap into the internet, which interconnects billions of devices worldwide. It's a complex and, potentially, perilous environment that requires IT expertise for management, security, maintenance and reliability.
        
        Examples of information technology
        So how is IT actually involved in day-to-day business? Consider five common examples of IT and teams at work:
        
        Server upgrade. One or more data center servers near the end of their operational and maintenance lifecycle. IT staff will select and procure replacement servers, configure and deploy the new servers, backup applications and data on existing servers, transfer that data and applications to the new servers, validate that the new servers are working properly and then repurpose or decommission and dispose of the old servers.
        Security monitoring. Businesses routinely employ tools to monitor and log activity in applications, networks and system IT staff receive alerts of potential threats or noncompliant behavior -- such as a user attempting to access a restricted file -- check logs and other reporting tools to investigate and determine the root cause of the alert and take prompt action to address and remediate the threat, often driving changes and improvements to security posture that can prevent similar events in the future.
        New software. The business determines a need for a new mobile application that can allow customers to log in and access account information or conduct other transactions from smartphones and tablets. Developers work to create and refine a suitable application according to a planned roadmap. Operations staff posts each iteration of the new mobile application for download and deploy the back-end components of the app to the organization's infrastructure.</p>
